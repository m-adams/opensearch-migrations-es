## Overview

**This is a fork of the [OpenSearch Migration Assistant](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-migrations) extended specifically for migrating to Elasticsearch Serverless on Elastic Cloud.**

### Why Elasticsearch Serverless?

Moving from OpenSearch to Elasticsearch Serverless isn't just a platform change‚Äîit's a fundamental shift in how you operate search infrastructure:

**What disappears:**
- Shard count calculations
- Replica factor tuning
- Node sizing decisions
- Capacity planning
- Manual scaling operations
- Infrastructure patching

**What you get:**
- Automatic scaling that responds to actual demand
- Zero infrastructure management
- Pay-per-use economics (scales to zero when idle)
- Enterprise security and compliance built-in
- Modern vector search with [Better Binary Quantization (BBQ)](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/elasticsearch/index-settings/bbq)

**For AWS users:** Elasticsearch Serverless is available through the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=4bd95219-3608-4318-8590-e86aface431e), making procurement seamless within your existing AWS relationship.

**Note:** This toolkit also supports Elastic Cloud hosted clusters, though those still require infrastructure management similar to OpenSearch Service (shards, replicas, capacity planning). The real operational transformation comes with Serverless.

OpenSearch Migration Assistant is a comprehensive set of tools designed to facilitate upgrades, migrations, and comparisons for OpenSearch and Elasticsearch clusters. This project aims to simplify the process of moving between different versions and platforms while ensuring data integrity and performance.

## Fork Highlights

This fork extends the upstream opensearch-migrations project with:

‚úÖ **Elasticsearch Serverless Support**
- Migrate from AWS OpenSearch to Elasticsearch Serverless (Elastic Cloud)
- Automatic settings sanitization for serverless compatibility
- Work coordination index adaptation (removes hidden index restrictions)
- API restriction handling (cluster settings, node APIs, etc.)

‚úÖ **Minimal, Maintainable Changes**
- ~120 lines of code across 3 files
- Clean separation from upstream code
- Easy to merge with upstream updates
- Follows existing version-specific patterns

‚úÖ **Production-Ready**
- Tested with real Elasticsearch Serverless deployments
- Comprehensive documentation and troubleshooting guides
- Support for both API key and basic authentication

üìö **Additional Documentation**
- [Elasticsearch Serverless Migration Guide](DocumentsFromSnapshotMigration/ELASTICSEARCH_SERVERLESS.md)
- [Serverless Implementation Details](../docs/serverless-implementation.md) (in parent repo)
- [Serverless Compatibility Matrix](../docs/serverless-compatibility-matrix.md) (in parent repo)

üîó **Upstream Project**: [opensearch-project/opensearch-migrations](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-migrations)

## Key Features

- **Upgrade and Migration Support**: Provides tools for migrating between different versions of Elasticsearch and OpenSearch.
  - **[Metadata Migration](MetadataMigration/README.md)**: Migrate essential cluster components such as configuration, settings, templates, and aliases.
  - **Multi-Version Upgrade**: Easily migrate across major versions (e.g., from Elasticsearch 6.8 to OpenSearch 2.15), skipping intermediate upgrades and reducing time and risk.
  - **Downgrade Support**: Downgrade to an earlier version if needed (e.g., from Elasticsearch 7.17 to 7.10.2).
  - **Existing Data Migration with [Reindex-from-Snapshot](RFS/docs/DESIGN.md)**: Migrate indices and documents using snapshots, updating your data to the latest Lucene version quickly without impacting the target cluster.
  - **Live Traffic Capture with [Capture-and-Replay](docs/TrafficCaptureAndReplayDesign.md)**: Capture live traffic from the source cluster and replay it on the target cluster for validation. This ensures the target cluster can handle real-world traffic patterns before fully migrating.

- **Elasticsearch Serverless Support** ‚≠ê _(Fork Extension)_:
  - **Automatic Settings Sanitization**: Removes forbidden settings (shards, replicas, codec, translog, merge policies) that aren't supported in serverless mode.
  - **Hidden Index Adaptation**: Converts hidden index names (e.g., `.migrations_working_state` ‚Üí `migrations_working_state`) to comply with serverless restrictions.
  - **API Restriction Handling**: Gracefully handles unsupported cluster APIs (`/_cluster/settings`, `/_nodes`, etc.) without breaking the migration flow.
  - **Work Coordination**: Multi-worker coordination using serverless-compatible index naming and settings.
  - **Authentication Options**: Supports both API key (recommended) and basic authentication methods.
  
- **Zero-Downtime Migration with [Live Traffic Routing](docs/ClientTrafficSwinging.md)**: Tools to seamlessly switch client traffic between clusters while keeping services fully operational.

- **Migration Rollback**: Keep your source cluster synchronized during the migration, allowing you to monitor the target cluster's performance before fully committing to the switch. You can safely revert if needed.

- **User-Friendly Interface via [Migration Console](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-migrations/blob/main/docs/migration-console.md)**: Command Line Interface (CLI) that guides you through each migration step.

- **Flexible Deployment Options**:
  - **[AWS Deployment](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/migration-assistant-for-amazon-opensearch-service/)**: Fully automated deployment to AWS.
  - **[Local Docker Deployment](/TrafficCapture/dockerSolution/README.md)**: Run the solution locally in a container for testing and development.
  - **Elasticsearch Serverless**: Direct migration to Elastic Cloud Serverless projects.
  - Contribute to add more deployment options.

Note that testing is done on specific minor versions, but any minor versions within a listed major version are expected to work.

### Platforms
  - Self-managed (cloud provider hosted)
  - Self-managed (on-premises)
  - Managed cloud offerings (e.g., Amazon OpenSearch)
  - **Elasticsearch Serverless (Elastic Cloud)** ‚≠ê _(Fork Extension)_
    - Requires `--target-type ELASTICSEARCH_SERVERLESS` flag
    - Supports API key and basic authentication
    - Automatic settings sanitization
    - See [Elasticsearch Serverless Migration Guide](DocumentsFromSnapshotMigration/ELASTICSEARCH_SERVERLESS.md)

### Performance Limitations
A performance test was performed on 03/10/25 alongside [PR 1337](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-migrations/pull/1337)
to identify general indexing throughput with Reindex-From-Snapshot and Traffic Replay. While Reindex-From-Snapshot
includes periods of ingestion inactivity (e.g. while downloading the shard data), this was not factored into the ingestion rates.
Test used docs with an average uncompressed size 2.39 KB (source doc and index command) which corresponded to 1.54 KB of primary shard size per doc on OS 2.17 with default settings

For real-word use, throughput can be increased by vertically scaling Reindex-From-Snapshot and Traffic Replay instances or horizontally scaling
the Reindex-From-Snapshot workers that are running on AWS Fargate. Outside the exception indicated, all cases are CPU limited for throughput.
All cases were using uncompressed network traffic generated by the applications, results will vary if using client compression.

Throughput here is measured by the rate of increase in primary shard data with bulk ingestion on the target cluster alongside
the uncompressed size of the source data ingested.

Tests were ran with and without the [Type Mapping Sanitization Transformer](./transformation/transformationPlugins/jsonMessageTransformers/jsonTypeMappingsSanitizationTransformer/README.md).

#### Test Results
| Service               | vCPU | Memory (GB) | Type Mapping Sanitization | Peak Docs Ingested per minute | Primary Shard Data Ingestion Rate (MBps) | Uncompressed Source Data Ingestion Rate (MBps) |

**[1] Network Bandwidth Limitations Observed**

**Note on Elasticsearch Serverless Performance:**
- Serverless automatically scales based on workload
- Initial performance may be slower as the platform scales up
- Performance improves as serverless adjusts to migration workload
- No manual capacity provisioning required
- Consider running multiple workers for large migrations
- See [Performance Considerations](DocumentsFromSnapshotMigration/ELASTICSEARCH_SERVERLESS.md#performance-considerations) in the Serverless Migration Guide

## Migrating to Elasticsearch Serverless

This fork adds comprehensive support for migrating to Elasticsearch Serverless (Elastic Cloud). The migration process is similar to standard migrations but includes automatic adaptations for serverless restrictions.

### Key Serverless Adaptations

| Aspect | Standard Elasticsearch | Elasticsearch Serverless | How We Handle It |
|--------|------------------------|--------------------------|------------------|
| **Work Coordination Index** | `.migrations_working_state` (hidden) | Cannot use dot-prefix indices | Automatically uses `migrations_working_state` |
| **Shard/Replica Settings** | User-configurable | Platform-managed | Automatically removed from index settings |
| **Cluster APIs** | Available | Limited/unavailable | Gracefully skipped with warnings |
| **Authentication** | Multiple options | API keys recommended | Supports both API keys and basic auth |

### Quick Start Example

```shell
./gradlew DocumentsFromSnapshotMigration:run --args="\
  --snapshot-name your-snapshot \
  --s3-repo-uri s3://your-bucket/snapshots/repo \
  --s3-region us-east-1 \
  --s3-local-dir /tmp/s3_files \
  --lucene-dir /tmp/lucene_files \
  --target-host https://your-project.es.region.aws.elastic.cloud \
  --target-api-key <your-api-key> \
  --target-type ELASTICSEARCH_SERVERLESS \
  --source-version OpenSearch_2_13"
```

### Critical Parameters for Serverless

| Parameter | Required? | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `--target-type ELASTICSEARCH_SERVERLESS` | **Yes** | Enables serverless mode with automatic adaptations |
| `--target-api-key` | **Recommended** | API key authentication (preferred method) |
| `--target-username` / `--target-password` | Alternative | Basic auth (use API key instead if possible) |
| `--source-version` | **Yes** | Source cluster version (e.g., `OpenSearch_2_13`) |

- `index.number_of_shards`
- `index.number_of_replicas`
- `index.auto_expand_replicas`
- `index.routing.allocation.*`

**Performance Settings:**
- `index.codec`
- `index.translog.*`
- `index.merge.*`
- `index.store.*`

**Allowed Settings** (preserved during migration):
- `index.refresh_interval`
- `index.max_result_window`
- Analysis settings (analyzers, tokenizers, etc.)
- Mapping definitions

## Getting Started

### Local Deployment

Refer to the [Development Guide](DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) for more details.

### AWS Deployment

To deploy the solution on AWS, follow the steps outlined in [Migration Assistant for Amazon OpenSearch Service](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/migration-assistant-for-amazon-opensearch-service/), specifically [deploying the solution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/migration-assistant-for-amazon-opensearch-service/deploy-the-solution.html).

### Elasticsearch Serverless Migration

‚≠ê **Fork Extension:** This deployment option is specific to this fork.

**Prerequisites:**
1. Source cluster (OpenSearch/Elasticsearch) with S3 snapshot
2. Elasticsearch Serverless project on Elastic Cloud
3. API key from Elastic Cloud

**Quick Start:**

```shell
# Navigate to opensearch-migrations-es directory
cd opensearch-migrations-es

# Run migration
./gradlew DocumentsFromSnapshotMigration:run --args="\
  --snapshot-name your-snapshot \
  --s3-repo-uri s3://your-bucket/snapshots/repo \
  --s3-region us-east-1 \
  --s3-local-dir /tmp/s3_files \
  --lucene-dir /tmp/lucene_files \
  --target-host https://your-project.es.region.aws.elastic.cloud \
  --target-api-key YOUR_API_KEY \
  --target-type ELASTICSEARCH_SERVERLESS \
  --source-version OpenSearch_2_13"
```

**Getting an API Key:**
1. Log into [Elastic Cloud](https://cloud.elastic.co)
2. Navigate to your Serverless project
3. Go to Management ‚Üí API Keys
4. Create a new API key with appropriate permissions
5. Copy the base64-encoded key

**Important Notes:**
- The `--target-type ELASTICSEARCH_SERVERLESS` flag is **required**
- Without this flag, the migration will fail with settings errors
- API key authentication is strongly recommended over basic auth
- Settings sanitization happens automatically

**Complete Guide:** See [Elasticsearch Serverless Migration Guide](DocumentsFromSnapshotMigration/ELASTICSEARCH_SERVERLESS.md) for detailed instructions, troubleshooting, and best practices.


## Continuous Integration and Deployment
We use a combination of GitHub actions and Jenkins so that we can publish releases on a weekly basis and allow users to provide attestation for migration tooling.
